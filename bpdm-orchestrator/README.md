# BPDM Orchestrator

The BPDM Orchestrator is a core service that supports the coordination of the data flow between the dedicated BPDM Gates of the Data Space Participants, the BPDM Pool and the Data Curation and Enrichment Services. It also manages the different statuses that a business partner data record can have during the Golden Record process. One key aspect of the BPDM Orchestrator is to maintain the anonymity of each Data Space Participant towards the Data Curation and Enrichment Services and the BPDM Pool, so that direct competitive advantages are not lost and antitrust regulations are not violated regarding the sharing of business partner data.

The BPDM Orchestrator offers an [API](../bpdm-orchestrator-api) to get tickets for the ticketing system.
