# BPDM Gate

The BPDM Gate is a core service with a standardized API used within data spaces to exchange business partner data. It allows Data Space Participants to provide their own company data, as well as the business partner data of their suppliers and customers (legal entities, sites, addresses) and consume validated and enriched Golden Records from the BPDM Pool with the BPN as a unique identifier. A staging area separates inputs from outputs, with status, error and change logs so that Data Space Participants can keep track of status and changes. Data Space Participants retain data sovereignty by providing their business partner data to their own dedicated BPDM Gate while benefiting from the Data Curation and Enrichment Services and the shared business partner data of other Data Space Participants. The result is cleaner and more interoperable business partner data, which forms the basis for identification of the Data Space Participants, invitation management and the general data exchange in a data space.

The BPDM Gate offers an [API](../bpdm-gate-api) to query and share business partners.
