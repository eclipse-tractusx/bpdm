## [6.1.0] - [2024-07-15]

### Added

### Changed

- BPDM Gate: Now sends alternative addresses which are NULL correctly to the Orchestrator ([#801](https://github.com/eclipse-tractusx/portal-backend/issues/801))

## [6.0.1] - [2024-05-27]

### Removed

- BPDM Gate: Remove unused business partner type filter in query parameters from sharing state endpoint (Does not affect behaviour of API)
- Apps: Add no-auth profile to all BPDM applications. This introduced a shortcut to run an application without any authentication configuration for its API and clients

### Changed

- BPDM Gate: Now correctly sending NULL values for alternative addresses to the golden record process
- BPDM Pool: Name search for business partners now case-insensitive and delivers results on partial matches
- BPDM Pool: Now validate and reject data in golden record tasks only if it is needed for processing (Unchanged business partners are now ignored)

## [6.0.0] - [2024-05-15]

### Removed

- BPDM Bridge (The Cleaning Dummy Service and Orchestrator are the successor applications to simulate a dummy golden record process)
- BPDM Gate: Removed all Legal Entity, Site and Address endpoints (The generic business partner endpoint is their successor)
- BPDM Gate: Removed legal entity classifications form business partner
- BPDM Gate: Removed business partner type from API models and filters
- BPDM Gate: Removed BPN from the sharing state (BPNs can be viewed in the output data of the business partner)
- APIs: Removed the static prefixes 'api/catena' from all API endpoint paths
- BPDM Pool: Removed the flags for `is legal address` and `is site main address` from the logistic address (since it is now expressed by the address type)

### Added

- BPDM Gate: Configuration to prevent the uploaded business partner input data to immediately enter the golden record process. 
In this configuration the business partner data needs to be sent to the golden record process manually over the new state/ready API endpoint.
Default configuration remains automatically sharing.
- BPDM Gate: Limited multi-tenancy support. Business partners are now separated by owner-BPNL.
The owner is determined from the 'bpn' claim in the token.
This means users of a Gate can only see and edit their own business partner data.
- BPDM Pool: New API endpoints to query business partner data which belongs to Catena-X members only
- APIs: Added a major version number to all API endpoint paths indicating the current version of the BPDM APIs.
In the future we will use version numbers in the URL to differentiate between all currently supported major versions of the API
- BPDM Gate Client: Now supports the stats endpoints of the BPDM API

### Changed

- Confidence Criteria: Corrected field name for number of sharing members (formerly number of business partners)
- BPDM Cleaning Service Dummy: Now determines business partner data to be Catena-X member data if it is claimed to be owned
- BPDM Cleaning Service Dummy: Fix ignoring BPNs coming from the sharing member
- BPDM Gate: Fix not correctly updating confidence values it receives from the golden record process
- BPDM Gate: Fix not correctly updating business partner output data from golden record updates in the Pool.
- JAVA version to 21
- BPDM API Permissions: Overhaul of the permissions needed to access the BPDM API endpoints.
Permissions are now more fine-granular and differentiate more clearly between read or write.
For more details consult the Arc42, API documentation and properties files of the respective applications.
- BPDM App Configuration: Now all applications are secured (authenticated and authorized) by default.
You can still deactivate security in the BPDM apps for testing or development purposes though.
- BPDM Pool: Fix Pool trying to update golden records which the golden record process indicated to have no changes
- BPDM Orchestrator: The business partner data for golden record process tasks has been completely overhauled.
Now business partner data is clearly divided into `uncategorized`, `legal entity`, `site` and `additonal address` data.
This model is less verbose and contains less duplicate data.
Additionally, both Pool and Gate can write and read from it making it unnecessary for a cleaning service to provide the data in two different models.
