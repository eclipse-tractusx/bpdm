 * In a Spring configuration a bean of this class is instantiated passing a webClientProvider which configures the web client with e.g. OIDC configuration.
 * A lazy HttpServiceProxyFactory private property is defined: On first access it creates a HttpServiceProxyFactory configured with the web client.
 * Several lazy API clients are defined: On first access they are created from the HttpServiceProxyFactory for the specific API interface.
 * All this has to be done lazily because during integration tests the web client URL may not be available yet on Spring initialization.
