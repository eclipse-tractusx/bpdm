# BPDM Cleaning Service Dummy

Data Curation and Enrichment Services are a set of external services potentially implemented by different service providers. They are used to clean, enrich and validate business partner data to finally create a Golden Record.

The BPDM Cleaning Service Dummy simulates the input of a Data Curation and Enrichment Service for the Golden Record process. It also allows service providers to figure out how to connect the BPDM Pool, BPDM Gate and BPDM Orchestrator to form the Golden Record process, the process on how a data record in the BPDM Gate becomes a Golden Record in the BPDM Pool which, in turn, gets distributed back to all BPDM Gates.
