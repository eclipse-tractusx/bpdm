## 7.1.x to 7.2.x

### Alternative Headquarters Restriction

Now each legal entity can have only up to one alternative headquarters.
Please make sure in your Pool and Gate output database each legal entity is part of up to only one such relation and remove relations that violate this constraint.
Otherwise, the golden record process may show unexpected behaviour. 

## 7.0.x to 7.1.x

### EDC Version 0.11

BPDM 7.1 was tested on and now supports EDC version 0.11.
The [Postman documentation](../postman) shows how to setup an offer and negotiation between two 0.11 EDCs.
The new EDC version now supports two different DCP versions 0.8 and 1.0.
Creating new offers with the new EDC is not backwards compatible for either DCP usage.
However, if you have migrated versions with existing offers, they will still be usable.
In our Postman examples we only show the usage of the 1.0 DCP including how to create new offers.

For more information have a look at the [migration guide for the EDC](https://github.com/eclipse-tractusx/tractusx-edc/blob/main/docs/migration/2025-09-Version_0.10.x_0.11.x.md).

### Golden Record Process for IsManagedBy Relations

This release introduces sharable IsManagedBy relations. 
If you have previously created IsManagedBy relations please note that these relations will be shared with the golden record process after migration.

### Business Partner Identifier Amount Limit

This release introduces a limit of 100 identifiers for a golden record.
If for whatever reason your golden record Pool contains a business partner with over 100 identifiers it is recommended to reduce that number to avoid unintended behaviour.
Sharing members can still upload business partners with more than 100 identifiers in their Gates.
However, the Pool will not accept such business partners (unless adjusted inside the refinement process).
