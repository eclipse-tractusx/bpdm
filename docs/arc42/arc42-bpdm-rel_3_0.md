# Introduction and Goals

Every participant in the Catena-X (CX) network shall have a unique Business Partner Number (BPN) according to the concept defined by the Catena-X BPN concept. The task of the BPN Generator is to issue such a BPN for a presented Business Partner data object. In that, the BPN Generator serves as the central issuing authority for BPNs within Catena-X. Technically, it constitutes a service that is available as a singleton within the network.

The CX datapool aims at collecting the business partner data objects from the service provider and giving the opportunity for other use cases and services to consume the data via an interface. The CX datapool is the central instance for business partner data within Catena-X.

In general, we have implemented most of the adapter based on the Interface to a SaaS (Software as a Service) Provider, who currently has the responsibility to clean up the data.

## Requirements Overview

Essentially constituting a service-oriented architecture running distributedly on distinct CX Nodes, there can - in principle - be multiple consumers submitting business partner data objects for identification. To fulfill this purpose, the following requirements shall apply:

| Req-Id  | Requirements                                                                                             |
| ------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| BPDM-R1 | The BPN Generator shall fit into the BPDM Architectural Framework.                                       |
| BPDM-R2 | The BPN Generator shall support the modes of operation as described in BPN Generator: Modes of Operation |
| BPDM-R3 | Regarding implementation technologies the BPN Generator shall follow the overall guidelines for Catena-X |
| BPDM-R4 | The datapool should follow the business partner data model BPDM Data Model Business Partner              |
| BPDM-R5 | The data should be available via API                                                                     |

## Quality Goals {#\_quality\_goals}

| Priority | Quality Goal            | Scenario                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| -------- | ----------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1        | Security                | All users and services which access the Golden Record Application must be authenticated and authorised. Only the Golden Record Application itself is allowed to perform changes on data. Consuming services/users are only allowed to read data. In addition they are only allowed to read the specific data that belongs with this, the Data Souvereignty principles of Catena-X has to be fulfilled |
| 1        | Integrity               | Only the Golden Record Application is allowed to perform changes on the data. In addition, all changes must be traceable and must be able to be rolled back                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| 1        | Legally                 | No natural persons are allowed to get uploaded and stored. For all other uploaded data (Business Partners) it is mandatory that Users (Sharing Members) can only see their own uploaded data and that it is not possible to draw conclusions about other business partner relationships                                                                                                               |
| 1        | Integrity & Correctness | It must be ensured that the data of the golden record which is created during the process is correct.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| 2        | Reliability             | The Golden Record Application is a central foundation in the Catena-X Network. It provides all participants and services, business partner data and the unique Business Partner Number (BPN) as identifier. Therefore the BPDM Services must be always/highly available                                                                                                                               |
| 2        | Functional Stability    | Since the Golden Record Application is a central foundation in the Catena-X Network the defined standards of the API and datamodel for the associated Release Version must be fulfilled                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| 1        | Sensitivity of data     | the uploaded business partner data is highly sensitive, that's why it must be ensured that no unauthorized user/system can access data which does not belong to it. More over it must be guaranteed that no one can see the business partners related to the specific Catena-X Member.  |

## Technical Context

![](images/technical-context.png)

**Catena-X Golden Record Application**
* The BPDM Golden Record Application which offers services to Catena-X Members, Catena-X Use Cases and Catena-X BPDM Value Added Services for consuming and processing business partner data as well as Golden Record Information and BPN Numbers.

**Golden Record Gate**
* The Golden Record Gate provides the interfaces for Catena-X Members to manage their business partner data within Catena-X. It forwards the uploaded business partners to a third party service provider to create a Golden Record Proposal.
* Currently the Gate only provides an API to interact with the data pools of the third party service providers. In the future, an own persistence layer will be introduced within the Gate, handling state and business logic.

**Golden Record Pool**
* The Golden Record Pool provides the interface and persistance for accessing Golden Record Data and the unique Business Partner Number.

**Catena-X Use Cases, Value Added Services, Member Applications**
* All of these Applications uses the Interface provided by Golden Record Pool to consume Golden Record Information.


## Deployment Context
![](images/deployment-context.png)

**Catena-X Operation Environment for Golden Record**

* The Golden Record Application will be a single central component. Therefore it will only be deployed in the environment of this operation company. This company can of course also operate or offer other Catena-X Services.

**External Service Provider**

* To create a golden record proposal, Catena-X uses external third party services. These services are operated and own by the external service provider.

**Catena-X Operations Enviornment xyz**

* In contrast to the central golden record component, other BPDM Value Added services are decentral and can be operated in any operation environment.

# Solution Strategy

Use a microservice approach to separate the different components of the system and design a generic part as well as a specific data provider and data consumer part.

* Kotlin
* Spring Boot
* Maven
* PostgreSQL Database
* REST
* OpenSearch
* Keycloak
* Helm
* Kubernetes

### Class Diagram Pool
![](images/class-diagram-pool.png)

## Blackbox (API Authentication)

For authentication the API uses a Bearer authentication (also called token authentication) is an HTTP authentication scheme that involves security tokens called bearer tokens.

The client must send this token in the Authorization header when making requests to protected resources:

Authorization: Bearer <token>

Keycloak

OAuth2

# Cross-cutting Concepts

## Business Partner Domain Model
![](images/business-partner-data-model.png)

## What is the Business Partner Number (BPN)?
A BPN is a unique identifier for a Business Partner, standardized for the Catena-X environment with overall 16 digits.

BPN ID syntax / structure:

| Prefix                                          | Classification                        | Identifier   | Check Digit                                     | Representation of a BPN |
| ----------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------- | ------------ | ----------------------------------------------- | ----------------------- |
| 3 digits                                        | 1 digit                               | 10 digits    | 2 digits                                        | BPNL1234567890ZZ        |
| Issuing Agency Code based on IS/IEC 15458 “BPN” | L = Legal entity S = Site A = Address | Alphanumeric | Checking algorithm based on ISO7064 MOD 1271-36 | BPN is used as a placeholder for the Issuing Agency according to ISO/IEC 15459. L identifies the legal entity of the Business Partner. ZZ is the individual check digit, which is formed according to ISO 7064. Note, for the human-readable representation of the BPN, the following input or reading aid is recommended: BPNL 1234 5678 90ZZ The use of a barcode or QR code can be assigned for machine-readable representation. |

# Risks and Technical Debts

**Open EDC Questions**
* What capabilites will be provided in the future?
* How to deal with APIs provided behind an EDC? Swagger documentation cannot be seen by the requesting service?
* How can we authorize and authenticate a User/System with individual permissions after it passes the EDC?
* ...

**Lack on Developer Resources**
* To less developer resources in contrast to the expectations that the BPDM Product and its Golden Record will be a foundation component within Catena-X.

**Semantic Model and SSI Integration of the Golden Record**
* Not done yet.

**Dependency on third party service provider**
* Currently we are not flexible enough to easiliy change the third party service provider for golden record creation. Therefore the next step will be to introduce an own data persistence layer, getting more independent.

**Data Storage concept**
* How to seperate Data and ensure data sovereignty?

**Accessability for SMEs**
* Uploading via CSV File. Does it requires an EDC?
