# Templates

Find all provided documentation templates in this folder. Please note that the _italic text 
and sentences_ should be removed. Feel free to add additional sections and subsections, however, make sure
that at least the sections of the templates marked as "mandatory" are filled.

## Decision Records

[Link](decision-record.md) to template.

Each decision record should be put in an appropriate folder that is following a naming pattern: 
`YYYY-MM-DD-title-of-decision-record`. This should be located at the [decision record folder](../developer/decision-records/) 
and contain all relevant files, at least a filled-out template named `README.md` and any additional images.

As of now, every merged decision record is in state `accepted`. Please make sure to add a comment to
a decision record that replaces a previous one with adding a hint: `superseded by [...]`.

## Use Cases

[Link](use-case.md) to template.

A use case describes how a user can reach a certain goal by using the BPDM API.

The use case document should include the following information:

1. Who is the specific user group
2. What is the problem to solve or goal to achieve
3. What are the steps necessary to reach that goal with the BPDM API
4. Example requests for these steps
